💬 Basic Chatbot
📘 Project Overview

This Basic Chatbot project was developed as part of my Python internship at CodeAlpha.
The main objective of this project is to create a simple text-based chatbot that can engage in basic conversation using predefined rules and responses.

The chatbot takes user input such as greetings or common phrases and responds appropriately using if-elif conditions. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of control flow, user interaction, and function-based programming in Python.

Through this project, I improved my understanding of loops, conditionals, and function design, while gaining experience in creating simple interactive programs.

🎯 Objective

To design a simple rule-based chatbot that provides predefined responses to user input.

🚀 Features

Responds to basic user inputs like “hello”, “how are you”, and “bye”

Uses rule-based logic with if-elif statements

Interactive text-based interface

Easy to modify and extend with more responses

🧠 Tech Stack

Python

If-elif statements for logic

Functions and loops for structure

Console input/output for interaction

⚙️ How It Works

The user types a message such as “hello” or “how are you”.

The chatbot checks the input using if-elif statements.

A predefined response is returned to the user.

The conversation continues until the user types “bye”.

💡 Example Conversation
You: hello  
Bot: Hi!  

You: how are you  
Bot: I'm fine, thanks!  

You: bye  
Bot: Goodbye!
